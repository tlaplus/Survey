Feels like this is something for only matlab users, not for software engineers.

I love TLA+. I use it in unexpected industries and for everything I can. The issues I had/have is the math. Not that its hard but I don't understand what all the symbols mean or were exactly they come from. I have only taken the video course. I started looking at the Specifying Systems book where in the beginning it talks about the different types of math but there are a lot more symbols in the book. So maybe a brief overview of every area of math explained in the same way it was in the book (which was great). But maybe after going through the book, I'll find all the symbols and other forms of math. Moreover, combining specs was confusing to me. I don't have a lot of experience and I know to use small specs for checking but if I want to build a larger spec, I'm kind of at a loss. However, I need to review all the material again. Lastly, converting specs to code is a common question. I believe it comes from a place of ignorance about knowing where specs fit into the entire process but finding examples in the field would help. Simple examples is all that's needed from what I can see. Maybe with a few advanced ones here and there. Resourceful people will look at the paxos algo that was in the video course and find the paxos algo implemented in their core language. But since its a FAQ, it seems both things are needed: explanation of where specs into the picture and some examples.","curtycurt01@gmail.com"

BTW I've read Practical TLA+, watched Lamport's Video Course, read Specifying Systems, and I still find I get stuck in a bad way due to the above problems. 

Learning TLA+ requires a significant mindshift and it would help a lot to have structured problems with increasing difficulty that take someone towards increasing mastery e.g. Peter Norvig's Design of Computer Programs course - which lays out a problem, and shows how a master solves it - https://www.udacity.com/course/design-of-computer-programs--cs212.

A catalog of problems with different solutions like Exercism (along with a difficulty score against each) - would also help a lot. A simple first step might be to mark each of the tlaplus/Examples with a difficulty score (and possibly add more intermediate difficulty examples).

I'm really keen to know how TLA+ can be applied in wider contexts than distributed and concurrent systems - particularly business / domain heavy problems - I can see the potential but I think the lack of structured, step-by-step help is a big stumbling block.","Yes"
